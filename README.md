This Excel file has 2 spreadsheets, one called DATASET which has raw data which has been cleaned and free of duplicates. The second worksheet has my DAY-1 work showing the total sales values, profits/losses, average sales per order, etc. 
I have used the unique() in Excel to extract different types of Product categories, Shipping, and Order Priorities.
